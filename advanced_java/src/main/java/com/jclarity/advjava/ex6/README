------
In this exercise, you are provided with some classes with JavaBean style 
properties.

The exercise is to write unit tests to test 100% of the possible code paths. 

In particular, you should test that calling a getter on a property after having 
called the corresponding setter returns the value originally supplied.

You should also write any other tests that are required.

How would your approach differ if equals() and hashCode() were overridden?
